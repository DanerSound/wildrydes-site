In this repo you will find a [Serverless web application on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/),
Here you will use AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Amplify, Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Cognito.
 
The first time i've tried this workshop i couldnt get access to requestUnicorn.js that is requested in module 3, so i included see under **repo_utils/**
also the reception of the mail for validate the registration could not arrive the first time, and you will have to accept the registration manualy.

To avoid run out of my free tair, i already disable all the modules.
